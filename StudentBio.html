        I am an editor that works in educational publishing here in NYC. I live in West Chelsea with my wife Meredith, who I met when were both undergraduates at the University of Chicago.

    <p>I've lived in NYC for nearly two years, after living in South Florida for about two and half years previously. I'm originally from Newburyport, MA, in the Greater Boston area. </p>
